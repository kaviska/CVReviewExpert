            <p>
              By accessing or using CVReviewExpert (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms &
              Conditions and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Service.

            <h2>2. Privacy-first processing (no storage + pre-redaction)</h2>
            <p>
              We prioritize privacy. We <strong>do not store</strong> personal or company-identifying
              information from your uploaded CV/resume or provided text. Before any analysis starts, we
              automatically <strong>remove personal and company identifiers</strong> from the text (e.g., name,
              email, phone, address, company names) and process only the redacted content. CV file contents
              and redacted text are processed in memory and are <strong>not stored</strong> in our databases.
              See our Privacy Policy for details.
